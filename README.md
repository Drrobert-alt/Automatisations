# Automatisations
Automatisations is a bioinformatics pipeline for efficient, reproducible processing of metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data. Developed since my Masterâ€™s and PhD, it automates QC, batch correction, and stats; freeing time for science and grants, which then enabled these costly -omics analyses.
